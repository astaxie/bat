# bat
A Go CLI, cURL-like tool for humans. Bat can be used for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers.

Inspired by [HTTPie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie). Thanks to the author!

## Installation

	go get -u github.com/astaxie/bat
	
make sure the `$GOPATH/bin` is added into `$PATH`

## Usage

Hello World:

	$ bat beego.me

Synopsis:

	bat [flags] [METHOD] URL [ITEM [ITEM]]
	
See also `bat --help`.	

### Examples

Basic settings - [HTTP method](#http-method), [HTTP headers](#http-headers) and [JSON](#json) data:

	$ bat PUT example.org X-API-Token:123 name=John

Any custom HTTP method (such as WebDAV, etc.):

	$ bat -method=PROPFIND example.org name=John

Submitting forms:

	$ bat -form=true POST example.org hello=World
	
See the request that is being sent using one of the output options:

	$ bat -v example.org

Use Github API to post a comment on an issue with authentication:

	$ bat -a USERNAME POST https://api.github.com/repos/astaxie/bat/issues/1/comments body='bat is awesome!'

Upload a file using redirected input:

	$ bat example.org < file.json
	
Download a file and save it via redirected output:

	$ bat example.org/file > file
	
Download a file wget style:

	$ bat --download example.org/file

Set a custom Host header to work around missing DNS records:

	$ bat localhost:8000 Host:example.com
	
What follows is a detailed documentation. It covers the command syntax, advanced usage, and also features additional examples.
	
## HTTP Method
The name of the HTTP method comes right before the URL argument:

	$ bat DELETE example.org/todos/7
	
Which looks similar to the actual Request-Line that is sent:

DELETE /todos/7 HTTP/1.1

When the METHOD argument is omitted from the command, bat defaults to either GET (with no request data) or POST (with request data).

## Request URL
The only information bat needs to perform a request is a URL. The default scheme is, somewhat unsurprisingly, http://, and can be omitted from the argument – http example.org works just fine.

Additionally, curl-like shorthand for localhost is supported. This means that, for example :3000 would expand to http://localhost:3000 If the port is omitted, then port 80 is assumed.

	$ bat :/foo

	GET /foo HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost

	$ bat :3000/bar
	
	GET /bar HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost:3000

	$ bat :

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost

If you find yourself manually constructing URLs with querystring parameters on the terminal, you may appreciate the param==value syntax for appending URL parameters so that you don't have to worry about escaping the & separators. To search for bat on Google Images you could use this command:

	$ bat GET www.google.com search=bat tbm=isch

	GET /?search=bat&tbm=isch HTTP/1.1

## Request Items
There are a few different request item types that provide a convenient mechanism for specifying HTTP headers, simple JSON and form data, files, and URL parameters.

They are key/value pairs specified after the URL. All have in common that they become part of the actual request that is sent and that their type is distinguished only by the separator used: `:`, `=`, `:=`, `@`, `=@`, and `:=@`. The ones with an `@` expect a file path as value.


|       Item Type         |	          Description           |
| ------------------------| ------------------------------ | 
|HTTP Headers `Name:Value`|Arbitrary HTTP header, e.g. `X-API-Token:123`.|
|Data Fields `field=value`|Request data fields to be serialized as a JSON object (default), or to be form-encoded (--form, -f).|
|Form File Fields `field@/dir/file`|Only available with `-form`, `-f`. For example `screenshot@~/Pictures/img.png`. The presence of a file field results in a `multipart/form-data` request.|
|Form Fields from file `field=@file.txt`|read content from file as value|
|Raw JSON fields `field:=json`, `field:=@file.json`|Useful when sending JSON and one or more fields need to be a Boolean, Number, nested Object, or an Array, e.g., meals:='["ham","spam"]' or pies:=[1,2,3] (note the quotes).|

You can use `\` to escape characters that shouldn't be used as separators (or parts thereof). For instance, foo\==bar will become a data key/value pair (foo= and bar) instead of a URL parameter.

You can also quote values, e.g. foo="bar baz".

You can also quote values, e.g. `foo="bar baz"`.
## JSON
JSON is the lingua franca of modern web services and it is also the implicit content type bat by default uses:

If your command includes some data items, they are serialized as a JSON object by default. bat also automatically sets the following headers, both of which can be overwritten:

|Content-Type	| application/json |
| -------------| ----------------- |
|Accept	        |application/json|

You can use --json=true, -j=true to explicitly set Accept to `application/json` regardless of whether you are sending data (it's a shortcut for setting the header via the usual header notation – `bat url Accept:application/json`).

Simple example:

	$ bat PUT example.org name=John email=john@example.org
	PUT / HTTP/1.1
	Accept: application/json
	Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
	Content-Type: application/json
	Host: example.org
	
	{
	    "name": "John",
	    "email": "john@example.org"
	}

Non-string fields use the := separator, which allows you to embed raw JSON into the resulting object. Text and raw JSON files can also be embedded into fields using =@ and :=@:

	$ bat PUT api.example.com/person/1 \
    name=John \
    age:=29 married:=false hobbies:='["http", "pies"]' \  # Raw JSON
    description=@about-john.txt \   # Embed text file
    bookmarks:=@bookmarks.json      # Embed JSON file

	PUT /person/1 HTTP/1.1
	Accept: application/json
	Content-Type: application/json
	Host: api.example.com
	
	{
	    "age": 29,
	    "hobbies": [
	        "http",
	        "pies"
	    ],
	    "description": "John is a nice guy who likes pies.",
	    "married": false,
	    "name": "John",
	    "bookmarks": {
	        "HTTPie": "http://httpie.org",
	    }
	}
	
Send JSON data stored in a file (see redirected input for more examples):

	$ bat POST api.example.com/person/1 < person.json
	
## Forms
Submitting forms is very similar to sending JSON requests. Often the only difference is in adding the `-form=true`, `-f` option, which ensures that data fields are serialized as, and Content-Type is set to, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8`.

It is possible to make form data the implicit content type instead of JSON via the config file.

### Regular Forms

	$ bat --form=true POST api.example.org/person/1 name='John Smith' \
    email=john@example.org

	POST /person/1 HTTP/1.1
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8

	name=John+Smith&email=john%40example.org

### File Upload Forms

If one or more file fields is present, the serialization and content type is `multipart/form-data`:

	$ bat -f=true POST example.com/jobs name='John Smith' cv@~/Documents/cv.pdf
	
The request above is the same as if the following HTML form were submitted:

```
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="http://example.com/jobs">
    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <input type="file" name="cv" />
</form>
```

Note that `@` is used to simulate a file upload form field.

## HTTP Headers
To set custom headers you can use the Header:Value notation:

	$ bat example.org  User-Agent:Bacon/1.0  'Cookie:valued-visitor=yes;foo=bar'  \
    X-Foo:Bar  Referer:http://beego.me/

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Accept: */*
	Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
	Cookie: valued-visitor=yes;foo=bar
	Host: example.org
	Referer: http://beego.me/
	User-Agent: Bacon/1.0
	X-Foo: Bar
	
There are a couple of default headers that bat sets:

	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Accept: */*
	Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
	User-Agent: bat/<version>
	Host: <taken-from-URL>

Any of the default headers can be overwritten.
